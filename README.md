# Enlister Bot
A discord bot ready to protect your server from raiders, spammers and trollers!
### How do I use it?
Bla bla
### Why do I need this stupid bot?
Well it's just a bot to protect your discord server. It happens to me alot and Dyno, or any other moderation bot was a pain to setup up and I didn't have time to, that's why I made Enlister bot. I am attempting to make this bot the most easiest/simple, effective and always online bot. If you want to help me with this project, dm me on discord, Pie#9196. Basically I'll be making a electron application, and a express.js website. I already know electron so express should be also easy.
### I still don't want the bot, can this bot do anything else useful at all?
Not yet. We are still focusing on security as our main goal, we will then move over to music and so on.
### Can I fork this bot and suggest edits?
Sure.
